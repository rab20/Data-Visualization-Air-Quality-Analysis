# Data-Visualization-Air-Quality-Analysis

## Problem Statement

The air quality index (AQI) is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis. It is a measure of how air pollution affects one's health within a short time period. The purpose of the AQI is to help people know how the local air quality impacts their health. The pollutants monitored are Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5),Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone(O3) etc.
Central Pollution Control Board is executing a nation-wide programme of ambient air quality monitoring known as National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) and you are part of the project. As part of the programme, below data has been collected.
 
Source: This data has been published on Open Government Data platform India by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change, and is updated periodically.

You have been tasked to perform an analysis of the data and present the results to the Chairman of CPCB. With the given context, you need to create a dashboard using TABLEAU. (Use the concepts learned in the class).


The objectives include 
Demonstrate the VISUALISATION CONTEXT
1.	WHO?KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE(First 2 questions are answered for you)
  <br> a.	List the primary groups or individuals to whom you’ll be communicating.
CPCB
  <br> b.	If you had to narrow that to a single person, who would that be?
CPCB CHAIRMAN
  <br> c.	What does your audience care about?
  <br> Answer:
  <br> Results of the analysis performed on the air quality data that has been collected.
  <br> d.	What action does your audience need to take?
  <br> Answer:
  <br> The below points might be included within the scope of actions the audience would take:
  <br> 1.	Evaluate the AQI based on the insights presented on the ambient air quality.
  <br> 2.	Identify how each of the pollutants are impacting the AQI of a place.
  <br> 3.	Come up with a uniform AQI level based on the current data, health impacts, lifestyle ,etc.
  <br> 4.	Educate citizens on the AQI level in their city and the associated health impacts of air pollution exposure.
  <br> 5.	Rank cities based for prioritizing actions based on the measure of AQI.
  <br> 6.	Come up with guidelines to keep AQI within the suggested limits.
  <br> 7.	For cities with poor or worse AQI, provide health advisory. 
<br> e.	What is at stake? What is the benefit if the audience acts in the way you want them to? What are the risks if they don’t?
<br> Answer:
<br> The air quality index (AQI) gives an understanding of the quality of air in a place by measuring the composition of pollutants in the air. Therefore it helps identify places with very poor air quality. The quality of air would directly impact the health of the people living in and around that area. Exposure to high amounts of pollutants can cause several short term and long term health issues like heart diseases, lung diseases like asthma, emphysema, COPD etc, mainly in pregnant women, the elderly and children under 14. 
<br> Hence it is very important to understand the AQI at both local and national levels to understand the contribution of various pollutants in air quality. This would subsequently help come up with measures to keep the air quality in check. Following these suggestions would help improve the air quality and prevent associated health risks. This would have a larger impact on the health of the entire nation. 
<br> Increasing population and the inevitable rapid development associated with this population growth would inadvertently contribute into poor AQI. This could be through various everyday activities. Hence if the advisory is not followed, it would be impossible to keep the AQI in check. We are directly putting ourselves and people around under very serious health risks by not acting in accordance.   
2.	WHAT?
<br> ●	What are you trying to communicate? What questions are you trying to answer/display in your visualizations? Write these as specific questions.  You need to come up with 3 questions at least, each of which will be answered using one Viz.
<br> ●	Data preparation needed to answer the specific queries must be done.
3.	Present the BIG IDEA.
<br> ●	It should: <br> (1) articulate your point of view, <br> (2) convey what’s at stake, and <br> (3) be a complete (and single!) sentence.
4.	HOW?
<br> a.	Chart 1: What type of viz did you create? Why did you select the viz that you did? 
<br> b.	Chart 2: What type of viz did you create? Why did you select the viz that you did?
<br> c.	Chart 3: What type of viz did you create? Why did you select the viz that you did?
<br> d.	For each of the Visualisation, identify at least 3 Gestalt principles employed. 
<br> e.	For each of the Visualisation, mention how you strategically used pre-attentive attributes to draw the audience's attention.
5.	Create your dashboard
